# captiveportal
This script is good for Ubuntu users with Gnome to use when having issues connecting to hotel Wifi hotspots. 

**It does the following: 
**

Refresh the WiFi connection
Restart NetworkManager
Flush DNS cache
Disable firewall
Force captive portal to open
Make web request
Reset proxy settings
Re-enable firewall

It should therefore be able to work around any captive portals that fail to load at a hotel or other hotspots found dotted across the world.
